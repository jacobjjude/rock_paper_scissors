# rock_paper_scissors

Created a rock paper scissors game playable through the inspect element on the HTML page.

Two playable versions: "round()" and "game()"

round() will simulate a single round and declare a winner

game() will play 5 rounds, keep count, and declare a winner at the end, displaying both the winner and the score.

Ties do not add anything to either count.
